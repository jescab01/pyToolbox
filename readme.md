# python Toolbox
Set of Python functions created ad-hoc to analyze and plot simulated brain signals. 

Main scripts contain functions to analyze functional connectivity, dynamical functional connectivity, spectral analysis and to manipulate and plot simulated brain signals. 

**(dynamical) Functional Connectivity (dynamics):** FC (PLV, AEC, CORR, PLI), dFC - Sliding Window approach, Kuramoto order, Phase Lag Entropy (PLE)

**Spectral analysis (fft):** multitapper, FFT, PSD; and extensions for extracting peaks and plotting

**Manipulation and plotting of signals:** Plot timeseries (timeseriesPlot); Cut signals into epochs of the same length (epochingTool); Filter in frequency bands and plot timeseries, phase and amplitude components of the Hilbert transform (plotConversions);
