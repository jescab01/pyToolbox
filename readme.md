# python Toolbox
Set of python functions created ad-hoc to analyze and plot simulated brain signals. 

Main scripts contain functions to analyze functional connectivity, dynamical functional connectivity, spectral analysis and to manipulate and plot simulated brain signals. 

**Functional connectivity (fc):** Phase Locking Value (PLV), Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC), Correlation (CORR), Phase Lag Index (PLI)

**Dynamical Functional Connectivity (dynamics):** Kuramoto order, Phase Lag Entropy (PLE), Sliding Window approach 

**Spectral analysis (fft):** multitapper, FFT, PSD; and extensions for extracting peaks and plotting

**Manipulation and plotting of signals:** Plot timeseries (timeseriesPlot); Cut signals into epochs of the same length (epochingTool); Filter in frequency bands and plot timeseries, phase and amplitude components of the hilbert transform (plotConversions);
